# Building custom packages

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a BRAND-NEW project. At the moment, this is NOT USABLE. Expect only rough edges.

## Overview

We package things that we rely on, but are not commonly/universally available in package managers. We are not taking requests at the moment, but that may change in the future. If you are willing to do the work, you can fork this project and add things that _you_ rely on.

## Usage

None at the moment. :)
